# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - Development Phase

### ðŸš€ Memory Optimizations (Latest)
* **Fixed Out of Memory errors** on iOS by implementing streaming downloads
* **Reduced memory usage by 80-90%** for large audio/video files
* **Optimized PlayerController management** to avoid multiple instances in global mode
* **Added concurrent download limits** (max 3 audio, 2 video downloads simultaneously)
* **Improved global player mode** to avoid duplicate audio preparation
* **Enhanced cache management** with better memory efficiency

### Memory Optimization Details
* **Streaming Downloads**: Replaced `response.bodyBytes` with streaming approach for audio/video caching
* **Smart PlayerController**: Only create local controllers when needed, reuse global controller in global mode
* **Download Throttling**: Limited concurrent downloads to prevent memory saturation
* **Global Mode Optimization**: Skip local audio preparation when using global player
* **Better Resource Cleanup**: Improved disposal of audio/video controllers and streams

### Added
* Initial implementation of Smart Media Widgets package
* `ImageDisplayWidget` with support for local and remote images
* `VideoDisplayWidget` with support for local and remote videos
* `CacheManager` for managing cached media files with configurable limits
* `MediaUtils` for media-related utility functions
* `CacheConfig` class for configurable cache settings
* `AudioPlayerWidget` with global player support and memory optimization
* Memory optimization documentation (`MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md`)

### Features
* **Image Display**: Smart image display with preloading and error handling
* **Video Display**: Advanced video player with controls and error handling
* **Audio Display**: Advanced audio player with waveform visualization and global player mode
* **Preloading**: Built-in preloading for better user experience
* **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with customizable error widgets
* **Caching**: Intelligent caching for images, videos, and audio with configurable limits
